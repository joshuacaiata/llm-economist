        - Nearest stone: Down → Down → Down → Left → Down → Down → Down → Right (8 steps)


        No previous decisions.


        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        5. AVOID repeating the same action over and over - this wastes time
        6. If you keep moving between the same positions, try a different direction
        IMPORTANT STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS:
        1. COLLECT RESOURCES: Move to 'W' tiles to get wood, 'S' tiles to get stone
        2. BUILD HOUSES: When you have wood+stone, move to 'B' tiles and build (gives {self.build_payout} coins!)
        3. AVOID WASTING MOVES: Don't move back and forth between same positions
        4. PRIORITIZE: Wood+Stone → Build House → Repeat (this is the main way to gain utility). You might also consider specializing (collect wood and stone and sell them, or buy them on the market and build houses).
        
        Your goal is to maximize utility. Building houses gives the biggest utility boost!
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.10408990157261566, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs 10 labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:

Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.10408990157261566, you will collect a second unit.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        5. AVOID repeating the same action over and over - this wastes time
        6. If you keep moving between the same positions, try a different direction
        IMPORTANT STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS:
        1. COLLECT RESOURCES: Move to 'W' tiles to get wood, 'S' tiles to get stone
        2. BUILD HOUSES: When you have wood+stone, move to 'B' tiles and build (gives {self.build_payout} coins!)
        3. AVOID WASTING MOVES: Don't move back and forth between same positions
        4. PRIORITIZE: Wood+Stone → Build House → Repeat (this is the main way to gain utility). You might also consider specializing (collect wood and stone and sell them, or buy them on the market and build houses).
        
        Your goal is to maximize utility. Building houses gives the biggest utility boost!
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.10408990157261566, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs 10 labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        IMPORTANT STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS:
        1. COLLECT RESOURCES: Move to 'W' tiles to get wood, 'S' tiles to get stone
        2. BUILD HOUSES: When you have wood+stone, move to 'B' tiles and build (gives {self.build_payout} coins!)
        3. AVOID WASTING MOVES: Don't move back and forth between same positions
        4. PRIORITIZE: Wood+Stone → Build House → Repeat (this is the main way to gain utility). You might also consider specializing (collect wood and stone and sell them, or buy them on the market and build houses).
        
        Your goal is to maximize utility. Building houses gives the biggest utility boost!
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.10408990157261566, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs 10 labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        5. AVOID repeating the same action over and over - this wastes time
        6. If you keep moving between the same positions, try a different direction
        IMPORTANT STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS:
        1. COLLECT RESOURCES: Move to 'W' tiles to get wood, 'S' tiles to get stone
        2. BUILD HOUSES: When you have wood+stone, move to 'B' tiles and build (gives {self.build_payout} coins!)
        3. AVOID WASTING MOVES: Don't move back and forth between same positions
        4. PRIORITIZE: Wood+Stone → Build House → Repeat (this is the main way to gain utility). You might also consider specializing (collect wood and stone and sell them, or buy them on the market and build houses).
        
        Your goal is to maximize utility. Building houses gives the biggest utility boost!
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.10408990157261566, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs 10 labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        5. AVOID repeating the same action over and over - this wastes time
        6. If you keep moving between the same positions, try a different direction
        IMPORTANT STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS:
        1. COLLECT RESOURCES: Move to 'W' tiles to get wood, 'S' tiles to get stone
        2. BUILD HOUSES: When you have wood+stone, move to 'B' tiles and build (gives {self.build_payout} coins!)
        3. AVOID WASTING MOVES: Don't move back and forth between same positions
        4. PRIORITIZE: Wood+Stone → Build House → Repeat (this is the main way to gain utility). You might also consider specializing (collect wood and stone and sell them, or buy them on the market and build houses).
        
        Your goal is to maximize utility. Building houses gives the biggest utility boost!
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.10408990157261566, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs 10 labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
