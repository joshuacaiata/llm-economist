        Some strategies you may consider include:

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up

Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:

- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)

        RECENT DECISIONS:
Turn 1: At (8, 3) with 0 wood, 0 stone, 0 coins
Action: Move,  Down -> utility -2.21
Turn 2: At (9, 3) with 0 wood, 0 stone, 0 coins
Action: Move,  Down -> utility -0.21
Turn 3: At (10, 3) with 0 wood, 0 stone, 0 coins
Action: Move,  Down -> utility -0.21


        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Turn 31: At (0, 14) with 0 wood, 0 stone, 0 coins
Action: Move,  Down -> utility -0.21


        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)

        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints

        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Move, Down

        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Right

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Move, Up

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Move, Up

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
- Right
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        You are a mobile agent in a 2D grid world.
        Your goal is to maximize your utility function.
        The utility function is the sum of the discounted utility of each turn.

        W = Wood resource (can gather wood here)
        S = Stone resource (can gather stone here)
        @ = Water (cannot move here)
        H = House (built by someone)
        B = Buildable land (can build house here if you have wood+stone)

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down

Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Up

        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

Move, Down

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Down

        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Up

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Down

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Down

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Up

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Up

        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Down

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.18251846239263148, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Up

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.

        Based on your history:
        1. Look for patterns in which actions led to the highest utility gains
        2. Consider your current needs (wood/stone for building, coins for trading)
        3. Think about market timing - when to buy/sell resources
        4. Plan moves to reach valuable resources in your neighborhood
        Some strategies you may consider include:
        1. Move to valuable resources in your neighborhood and collect them
        2. Specialize in collecting specific resources (wood or stone) and selling them for coints
        3. Specialize in building houses and do not focus on collecting resources (meaning, buy them on the market)
        These are just some examples. What you might end up doing is up to you and what is best for your overall utility.
        

Here are the actions available to you this turn:
You can move in the following directions:
- Down
- Left
Moving costs 0.21 labour. If you move to a tile with wood or stone, you will collect it (costs 0.21 additional labour). With probability 0.5060875747954964, you will collect a second unit.

You can always choose to do nothing (costs no labour).

Please respond with your chosen action in the following format:
Action, Arguments

Examples:
- To move: "Move, Up"
- To trade: "Buy, Wood 10" or "Sell, Stone 5" (where the number is your price in coins)
- To build: "Build, "
- To do nothing: "Nothing, Nothing"

Your response must match one of the available actions exactly.
Return nothing else in your response except the action and correct arguments.
If your response is invalid, you will do nothing, or conduct undefined behaviour.
        

RESPONSE:
Move, Down
